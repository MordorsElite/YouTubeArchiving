00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.460
Buddy!


00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:00.920
Oh god.


00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.840
The day is the day.


00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.279
Already?


00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:02.540
Well.


00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.839
The release of what's bound to be my new favorite show of all time.


00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.679
I'm glad you're excited.


00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.140
At first I was nervous they were adapting all 42 books of Mr. Pissed Shard into a two episode


00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.339
streaming series, but I can't lie.


00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.699
I'm gonna love anything within the Shard universe.


00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.460
Even though they're calling it he who's shard.


00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320
You know, I've made my piece with that title, JJ.


00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:20.839
After all, it's a different medium, and then you know a studio.


00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.300



00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.160
That's what.


00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.179
Oh, I'm good.


00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.820
Dude, this is important to me.


00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:27.699
Oh, I'm gonna watch it.


00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:28.480
Just not with you.


00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.179
You owe me a clear explanation, young man.


00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.140
We're the same age.


00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.700
I get that you say that it's a different medium.


00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.539
You understand that.


00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.539
You understand the changes have to be made.


00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.920
I have.


00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.039
But you are going to become your worst self when you watch it.


00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:40.159
Why?


00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.179
You'll become a demon.


00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280
Oh, Mr. Shard would never use a bidet.


00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.439
Mr. Shard would never wipe.


00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.340
Well, first off, it's Mr. Pissed who shards.


00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:48.659
Second, this is a bidetless universe.


00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.579
I thought you read the wiki.


00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.920
What I'm saying is I just want to enjoy the show for what it is.


00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.479
Me too.


00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.439
That's not true.


00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.000
It is true.


00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.399
Okay, we'll watch it.


00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.820
Yes, but please be.


00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.240
Pressing play right now.


00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.479
So far, this is really faithful.


00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.000
We've got Mr. Pissed Seniors Rebellion, the Shard Market Collab.


00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:12.500
I'm glad that a show can be faithful to mega fans like me while still being entertaining


00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.640
for General Loddy.


00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.159
Now that's a twist.


00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:20.099
