### Youtube Archiving

## Motivation
    Over the last years I have noticed more and more videos vanishing from the internet.
    My liked playlist alone is missing dozens. Be it deleted channels, videos being privated
    by the uploader or copyright disputes. It is just a shame to watch them disappear.

    So since storage is pretty cheap, I've decided to just start archiving. 

## ToDo
    [ ] Organisation:
		[x] Videos stored in single directory with uniform names
		[ ] Searchable by title, channel, url, upload date, download date, subtitle content, download source
	[ ] Automation:
		[ ] Access to channel to automatically download new additions to liked videos or watch-history
	[x] Video quality:
		[x] Highest quality up to a max of 1080p (currently targetting formats 299+140)
		[x] Try to use AV1 if available
	[ ] Automatically add subtitles to videos:
		[ ] Add Manually Created Subtitles if available (en, de)
		[ ] Add Autogenerated Subtitles if available (en, de)
		[x] Generate Subtitles myself if subtitles are not available
		[x] Convert youtube-subtitles to iterative subs compatible with mpv (en, de)
		[x] Convert youtube-subtitles to iterative and non-iterative subs with improved sentence structure (en)
		[ ] Additionally store subtitle files seperately for search
			[ ] Need to find optimal storage method (might not be just individual files)
	[x] Add Metadata (If possibe) or store seperately:
		- Video-id
		- Upload date
		- Channel name
		- Download date
		- Thumbnail
		- Download Source (ie: Watch History, Liked Playlist)
